# Adaptive Efficiency Monitor Simulator (AEMS)

The **Adaptive Efficiency Monitor Simulator (AEMS)** is a web-based application designed to track and forecast performance metrics using an **Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)** model. It provides users with a dynamic, interactive interface to simulate efficiency trends, analyze historical data, and predict future performance based on customizable event-driven scenarios. AEMS is ideal for applications in personal productivity, quality control, health tracking, and business metrics.

The live version of the application is available at: [https://adaptive-efficiency-monitor.netlify.app/](https://adaptive-efficiency-monitor.netlify.app/).

## Overview
AEMS allows users to input historical performance data, define event types with associated severity scores, and simulate future performance over a specified period. The application uses an EWMA algorithm to provide adaptive scoring, giving more weight to recent performance while retaining historical context. Users can run single simulations to see day-by-day progress or perform aggregate analyses across multiple simulations to understand performance trends and probabilities.

The application is particularly useful for:
- **Personal Productivity**: Tracking habits, mistakes, or goal achievement.
- **Quality Control**: Monitoring defects or process failures.
- **Health & Wellness**: Tracking dietary lapses or medication adherence.
- **Business Metrics**: Measuring customer satisfaction or operational efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Adaptive Scoring**: Uses EWMA to weigh recent performance more heavily.
- **Event-Based Tracking**: Allows users to define custom events with severity scores.
- **Predictive Forecasting**: Estimates the number of perfect days needed to reach a target efficiency.
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Generates realistic scenarios based on user-defined probabilities.
- **Aggregate Analysis**: Runs multiple simulations to provide statistical insights, including histograms and line charts.
- **Interactive UI**: Features a responsive, modern interface with real-time updates and visualizations.
- **Open Source**: Available on GitHub for contributions and customization.

## How It Works

### EWMA Model
The Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) algorithm calculates efficiency by assigning exponentially decreasing weights to older performance data. The formula is:

```
New Efficiency = α × Daily Performance + (1 - α) × Previous Efficiency
```

Where:
- **α (alpha)**: Smoothing factor (0 < α ≤ 1). Higher values make the model more responsive to recent changes, while lower values provide stability.
- **Daily Performance**: A score between 0 and 1, calculated based on the day's events.
- **Previous Efficiency**: The efficiency score from the previous day.

### Daily Performance Calculation
Daily performance is determined by the total severity of events that occur on a given day, relative to a user-defined maximum daily severity:

```
Daily Performance = 1 - (Total Daily Severity / Max Daily Severity)
```

- **Perfect Day**: No events occur, resulting in a performance score of 1 (100%).
- **Worst Day**: Total severity equals or exceeds the maximum, resulting in a score of 0 (0%).
- **Other Days**: Performance is proportional to the severity of events.

### Forecasting
AEMS forecasts the number of consecutive perfect days needed to reach a target efficiency using the following formula:

```
Days Needed = ⌈ln((1 - Target Efficiency) / (1 - Current Efficiency)) / ln(1 - α)⌉
```

This provides a realistic estimate of the effort required to achieve a performance goal.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS3**: Styling, including responsive design with Tailwind-inspired gradients and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic, including the Efficiency Monitor class and Chart.js for visualizations.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering histograms and line charts in aggregate analysis.
- **Netlify**: Hosting the live deployment.

## Installation and Setup
To run AEMS locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yaseen454/adaptive-efficiency-monitor.git
   cd adaptive-efficiency-monitor
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   Since AEMS is a static web application, no server setup is required. Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

3. **Optional: Use a Local Server**:
   For a better development experience, you can use a local server. For example, with Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - The application uses Chart.js via a CDN, so no additional installations are needed.
   - Ensure you have an internet connection for the Chart.js CDN to load.

## Usage Guide

### Simulator Tab
The **Simulator** tab is the main interface for running simulations. It includes several sections:

1. **Historical Data**:
   - **Number of Bad Events**: Enter the number of negative events in your historical data (e.g., days with issues).
   - **Total Duration (days)**: Specify the time period for your historical data.
   - The initial efficiency is calculated as: `1 - (Bad Events / Duration)` and displayed as a percentage with a progress bar.

2. **Simulation Parameters**:
   - **Days to Simulate**: Number of days to run the simulation (1–365).
   - **Max Daily Severity**: The maximum severity score for a single day.
   - **Target Efficiency Increment**: The desired percentage increase over the initial efficiency.
   - **Smoothing Factor (α)**: Controls the responsiveness of the EWMA model (0.01–1).
   - **Perfect Day Probability**: The likelihood of a day with no events (0–100%).
   - **Second Event Probability**: The chance of a second random event occurring (0–100%).

3. **Event Severity Profile**:
   - Define event types (e.g., "Minor Issue") and their severity scores.
   - Add or remove events using the "Add Event Type" and "Remove" buttons.

4. **Simulation Controls**:
   - **Run Simulation**: Starts a single simulation, displaying day-by-day results and statistics.
   - **Clear Output**: Resets the simulation output.

5. **Aggregate Analysis**:
   - **Number of Simulations**: Specify how many simulations to run (10–10,000).
   - **Max Events Per Day**: Set the maximum number of events per day for the analysis.
   - **Run Aggregate Analysis**: Executes multiple simulations and displays statistical summaries and charts.

### How It Works Tab
This tab provides a detailed explanation of the AEMS methodology, including:
- The EWMA formula and its parameters.
- How daily performance is calculated.
- The forecasting algorithm.
- Practical applications and a step-by-step example.

### Running a Simulation
1. Enter historical data (e.g., 42 bad events over 120 days).
2. Set simulation parameters (e.g., 25 days, max severity of 10, α = 0.04).
3. Define at least one event type in the severity profile.
4. Click **Run Simulation** to view the day-by-day output, including:
   - Events that occurred.
   - Daily performance.
   - Current efficiency.
   - Forecasted days to reach the target.
5. Review the final summary and statistics, such as final efficiency and perfect days.

### Running Aggregate Analysis
1. Configure the same parameters as for a single simulation.
2. Specify the number of simulations and max events per day.
3. Click **Run Aggregate Analysis** to generate:
   - Statistical summaries (e.g., average final efficiency, goal achievement rate).
   - Charts:
     - Histogram of final efficiencies.
     - Histogram of days to goal.
     - Line plot of final efficiencies over simulations.
     - Line plot of days to goal over simulations.

## Example Scenario
Suppose you want to track your study focus over a 120-day period, where you had 42 days with distractions. Here's how to use AEMS:

1. **Historical Data**:
   - Bad Events: 42
   - Duration: 120
   - Initial Efficiency: `(1 - 42/120) × 100 = 65%`

2. **Event Severity Profile**:
   - "Minor Distraction": Severity 1
   - "Major Procrastination": Severity 4

3. **Simulation Parameters**:
   - Days to Simulate: 25
   - Max Daily Severity: 10
   - Target Increment: 20% (goal: 85% efficiency)
   - Smoothing Factor: 0.04
   - Perfect Day Probability: 40%
   - Second Event Probability: 35%

4. **Run Simulation**:
   - The output shows daily events, performance, and efficiency updates.
   - For example, a day with "Major Procrastination" (severity 4) has a performance of `1 - (4/10) = 60%`.
   - The new efficiency is calculated as: `0.04 × 60% + 0.96 × 65% ≈ 64.8%`.
   - The forecast might indicate 21 perfect days needed to reach 85%.

5. **Run Aggregate Analysis**:
   - Set 100 simulations with a max of 5 events per day.
   - Review charts and stats to understand the distribution of outcomes.
